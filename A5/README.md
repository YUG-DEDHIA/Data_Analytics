For n=2 cluster, average silhouette score is 0.56 which means the cluster had very compact data points.
Rest of the clusters have average silhouette score less than 0.5 which means the clusters are not compact and have overlapping data points.
Dendrograms for the clusters are shown in the jupyter notebook
The clusters are formed on the basis of 'BallControl','SlidingTackle', 'Overall', 'Balance', 'Jumping', 'Potential', 'Weak Foot', 'Jumping', 'Strength','FKAccuracy' attributes.
