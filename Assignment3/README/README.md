Q5. We chose Apriori algorithm over FP growth because intially when trying FP Growth we encountered with some errors which forced us to use apriori.
The Apriori algorithm advantages are as follows:

1.This is the most simple and easy-to-understand algorithm among association rule learning algorithms
2.The resulting rules are intuitive and easy to communicate to an end-user
3.It doesn't require labeled data as it is fully unsupervised; as a result, you can use it in many different situations because unlabeled data is often more accessible
4.The algorithm is exhaustive, so it finds all the rules with the specified support and confidence
